## *Pairing* *Station*


Before starting to *pair*, there should be a good space available that can facilitate and improve the *pairing* session. However, don’t let this be a barrier to pairing, if you can’t make/find a good space, ad-hoc over the shoulder pairing still works great! While having all of the criteria for the ideal *pairing* space is awesome, you’ll still get a lot of benefit even from pairing on a laptop at a table in the lunch area.

The ideal *pairing* *station* should meet the following criteria:

* Supports ease of screen reading for both *pairers*
* Makes it easy to switch the *driver* and *navigator*
* Makes it easy for both of the *pairers* to take the *driver*'s seat
* Isn't physically uncomfortable for either *pairer*
* Allows for direct communication
* Allows the *pairers* to communicate indirectly (e.g. visual cues)
* Includes a whiteboard for discussion
* In-person, though remote is possible if the environment can meet the above criteria.

### Screens

For in person *pairs*, having two monitors mirrored allows both *pairers* to see the work without looking over each other's shoulders.

For remote *pairs*, either screen sharing or live code sharing can work effectively. While live code sharing helps with switching, it makes it difficult to track non-code work.

### Switching

For in person *pairs*, having two keyboards and two mice works very well when combined with two mirrored monitors.

For remote *pairs* using some sort of live code sharing can make it simpler to switch *drivers*.

### Easy Driving

This is the hardest part.

For in person *pairs*:

* The keyboard(s) and mouse should be comfortable to use for both *pairers*. E.g.
* If one member uses left handed mice, the mouse they are using should work for them
* The keyboards should be in a layout that is familiar to the *pair* using it
* Shortcuts and productivity commands should be comfortable for both *pairers*
	* The IDE plays a big part in this. E.g.
		* RubyMine/Atom/VSCode shortcuts and plugins
		* Vim commands and plugins
		* RubyMine/Atom/VSCode Vim integration can simplify switching when one member uses Vim and another uses an IDE
		* The command lookup shortcut can help
			* `CMD + SHIFT + A` for RubyMine
	* The OS and apps installed can also play a part
		* What type of shell
		* SequelPro vs mysql
		* Debugging tools
		* Postman
		* Browser

Any time a *pairer* ends up driving out of necessity check that it isn't because of the environment.

For remote *pairs*:

* Same as in person
* Having the environment local to one *pairer* can make it harder for both to drive
* Connectivity problems
* Switching delays
* Lack of access to shared resources

### Physically comfortable

The area both *pairers* are working in should be comfortable.

For in person *pairs*:

* Both *pairers* should have the same amount of physical space, especially when driving
* Both *pairers* should be able to sit comfortably while taking up either role
* Take into account all the normal considerations for comfort in the work place

For remote *pairs*:

* Both *pairers* need to be physically comfortable, can't have one (or both) member(s) in a cramped phone booth

### Direct Communication

The *pair* needs to be able to communicate directly, often verbally. If one or both of the *pairers* is a person with a disability that prevents verbal communication modify for other forms of communication. The goal is to be able to keep a constant dialogue going.

For in person *pairs*:

* The *pairers* need to be able to hear each other
* The work environment needs to allow for discussions and open communication, or the *pair* needs to have their own room

For remote *pairs*:

* Like in person, the *pairers* need to hear each other
* Both *pairers* need to be able to be loud enough to hear one another
* Both *pairers* need to easily hear/see the other *pairer*

### Indirect Communication

A large part of communication is not direct and triggered through subtle cues. If one or both of the *pairers* is visually impaired modify the recommendations for other indirect cues.

For in person *pairs*:

Able to see each other well enough to pick up on visual cues

For remote *pairs*:

* Both *pairers* need to be able to see each other while working, this can be tricky when sharing a screen.
* The *pairers* should be able to see each other's visual cues.

### Whiteboard

Having a whiteboard or some paper available for diagrams can help facilitate discussion immensely.

For in person *pairs*, an actual whiteboard or some paper works well.

For remote *pairs*, a piece of paper with the camera trained on it, or even better some virtual whiteboard.
