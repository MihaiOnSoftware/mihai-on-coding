## Addressing Pitfalls

The greatest pitfalls to pairing are:

* *Disengagement*
* *Watch the master*
* Communications breakdown
* Conflict

The first two can most often be resolved by switching the *driver* and *navigator* more often. Additionally by taking a more passive role in the *pair* and allowing the other *pairer* to take the lead. For some ways to facilitate this, take a look in the [Techniques](techniques.md#Techniques) section, specifically [Ping-pong *Pairing*](techniques.md#ping-pong-pairing) and [Pomodoro *Pairing*](techniques.md#pomodoro-pairing).

For communications breakdown, where the *pairers* aren’t able to understand one another or feel unheard, taking a break from typing and having a discussion can help. One thing to try here is [Digging for Gold](techniques.md#digging-for-gold), this often works very well to get the *pair* through a tough spot.

Conflict between the two *pairers* does happen sometimes. Addressing this is tricky and this doc won’t go into detail, but there are a lot of techniques on conflict resolution that can be helpful. There are quite a few [resources](http://sedano.org/toddsedano/2017/10/22/considerate-pair-programming.html) on pair programming specifically as well.
